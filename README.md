# skyrim-predictor
I'm not so sure about this one but I recently started learning data science and I wanted to practice what I've been learning so I made this little predicter code that basically looks at a dataset of skyrim weapons and predicts how much gold a weapon will cost based on external factors like damage, material, amount of upgrades, and others.
